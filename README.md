Jaemi-Hubo
==========

A [forked project](https://github.com/auxsophia/jaemi-hubo) for a humanoid robot. The UNLV robotics lab in which I studied from the fall of 2014 to summer 2015 participated in the [2015 DARPA Robotics Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Robotics_Challenge) obtaining 8th place in the finals in an international competition. I watched over our booth and worked with an older model humanoid, Jaemi. I trained in the maintenance, operation, and coding of Jaemi. For the challenge, I programmed Jaemi to perform "hello, world" in sign language. Unfortunately, Jaemi's fingers were broken for the challenge (probably from a bad night of gambling at Las Vegas casinos), and I was never able to execute my code.
